Once a model has been fitted to a dataset, it contains a collection of coefficients by which each of the inputs are multiplied. Here we show how those coefficients can be used to construct an equation for predicting the outcome variable y.

```{r fitting_model}

get_equation <- function(model, mode="math"){
  beta <- signif(coef(model), digits=4)
  # mode = "math" or "code"
  assignOp <- switch(mode, math="=", "<-")
  multOp <- switch(mode, math="", "*")
  paste( "y", assignOp, beta[1] , "+", paste( beta[-1], names(beta[-1]), sep=multOp, collapse=" + "))
}

# Sample size; large samples let us estimate the coefficients accurately
N <- 10000

# Start with a data frame of independent variables:
df <- data.frame(
  a = rnorm(N, mean=50, sd=20),
  b = rnorm(N, mean=50, sd=20),
  c = rnorm(N, mean=50, sd=20),
  d = rnorm(N, mean=50, sd=20),
  e = rnorm(N, mean=50, sd=20)
)

# These are the actual coefficient values used to determine the dependent variable:
I <- 1.111; A <- 2.222; B <- 3.333; C <- 4.444; D <- 5.555; E <- 6.666

# The dependent variable 'y' is a linear function of the independent variables:
df$y <- with(df, I + A*a + B*b + C*c + D*d + E*e) + rnorm(N, sd=2)

# Fit the model
fit <- lm( y ~ ., data=df)

# Generate character strings representing the equation containing model coefficients:
math_equation <- get_equation(fit, mode="math")
code_equation <- get_equation(fit, mode="code")
```

The equation extracted from the model is:
$$
`r math_equation`
$$

In R code, this is represented as:
```
`r code_equation`
```
