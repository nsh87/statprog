undefined variables in the function based on order.
*  Each period acts as an anonymous parameter in the function.

What does the `magrittr` library do in `R`?

* It makes the operator `%>%` in an `R` script act a lot like the pipe character `|` , in the Unix terminal, though it is not the pipe character.
*  It allows one to use the pipe character, `|`, in an R script in the same way that it is used in the terminal.
*  It offers a more confusing alternative to the typical passing of arguments into a function, using the `$` character. For this reason, it is becoming less popular among programmers.

The 'stringsAsFactors = FALSE' option is useful when reading a data file because:

* all choices are correct
* it allow us to keep character variables as they are rather than convert to factors 
* the default in R is for columns with character data to be made into factors
* even if stringsAsFactors= F, it is easy to convert character data to factors using as.factor()

When working with databases through R on your local computer, what is the
advantage of working with SQLite instead of MySQL?

* SQLite uses a flat file, as opposed to requiring a database connection.
*  There isn't an advantage because there is no way to connect to a SQLite
database in R.

connect to the database simultaneously.
*  There are no packages to connect to a MySQL database in R.
