*  B :  It allows one to use the pipe character, `|`, in an R script in the same way that it is used in the terminal.
*  C :  It offers a more confusing alternative to the typical passing of arguments into a function, using the `$` character. For this reason, it is becoming less popular among programmers.

)
```

*  A :  Always result in the same data
*  B :  Always result in males having more large sizes
*  C :  Only sometimes result in the same data, as the code does not identify a seed.
